    return str

s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

print("The original string is : ", end="")

string= “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”
print(string.replace(“the”, “a”))
print(string)

def word_count(str):
    counts = dict()
    words = str.split()

    for word in words:
        if word in counts:
            counts[word] += 1
